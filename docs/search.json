    "text": "In machine learning, the evaluation metric is a crucial component of the model development process. The evaluation metric is used to assess the performance of a model and determine how well it is performing on a given task. The choice of evaluation metric can have a significant impact on the model results. Here, I provide an overview of how I selected the evaluation metric for the imputation model that predicts the race and ethnicity of people in the Fatality Analysis Reporting System.\nThe multiclass receiver operating characteristic area under the curve (mROCAUC) is selected for the race and ethnicity imputation model because it aligns with the disparity estimation objective of the study."
